          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p class="readable">
            I am a software craftsman with over 20 years experience delivering excellence. I have shipped software on a
            variety of platforms including web, desktop, and mobile. I excel at learning new technologies and utilizing
            them to rapidly building applications.
          </p>
          <p class="readable">
            I have an entrepreneurial spirit and a drive to get things done. I excel at turning requirements into a
            viable and deliverable road map that gets a product delivered fast.
          </p>
          <p class="readable">
            I focus on test driven development as the best method to develop quality software. I prefer simple code to
            clever code. I use open source solutions where possible so that I do not waste time re-inventing the wheel.
            I keep it simple, keep it reliable, and continually deliver.
          </p>
          <p class="readable">
            I use agile methodologies throughout my life creating small iterations that lead to larger goals. I am not
            afraid to recognize mistakes and face the hardest truths first.
          </p>
          <p class="readable">
            I enjoy teaching and mentoring fellow developers. I regularly contribute back to the developer community
            through hackathons, training, and presenting at user groups.

          The reason we could run so lean was because JB did so much. Our competitors required teams of full time
          employees to deliver the same features as JB did by himself. He not only built what I asked for, but he also
          built tools and reports I didn't know we needed until we did. Always on call. Always responsive. Sports Tradex
          wouldn't have been possible without him.

        <p class="quote">Jonathan excels in software architecture, design and development. His analysis skills are
          excellent which helps him to quickly understand 'true' application requirements. Jonathan can lead the design
          and development effort of any software project. With just minimal high-level requirements, Jonathan is able to
          quickly develop a design for any technical challenge whether it is for a back-end system need or a front-end
          user interface requirement. He is able to tackle any issue while continuing to improve and refine the system
          design. He is also a great team collaborator and mentor for junior developers, teaching them the importance of
          system design and testing during the entire software development life-cycle. If given the choice, I would
          always want to have Jonathan on my team leading the development effort.

                    on new technologies (Elixir + React) and agile methodologies. Within first year, founders and
                    customers commented on the dramatic turn around on reduction in bugs and speed in delivery of new
                    features.

                    Landdox was targeting larger customers and moving up market. Venture capital was being acquired for
                    this move before the acquisition by Quorum for $20M which was a 10x valuation. The engineering
                    improvements were a key component in our success and the acquisition.

                    sports contest site. Besides the complex logic around futures trading, the application needed to
                    have live updating of stats and market changes. The application started with simple Rails pages and
                    grew to add more advanced AngularJS SPA experiences. The application also needed to integrate with
                    Sports Direct's stats feed. This involved creating a separate proxy service that would parse the XML
                    and provide live scoring and stats updating using Pusher. Eventually performance and scaling being a
                    factor so many of the features of the application were moved over to Elixir and Phoenix.

                    I had been using AngularJS with several Rails projects and felt there wasn't a practical resource
                    for using the two together. I worked with Jesse Wolgamott and we first put together an Angularails
                    workshop. We gave the workshop at Lone Star Ruby Conference 2013. Afterwards we decided to package
                    all the material and code into a book: Angularails (<a
                      href='http://www.angularails.com/'>http://www.angularails.com/</a>). I found a love for writing
                    about code and have subsequently published new books and got back to blogging.
